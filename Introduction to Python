# Introduction to Python

# Python: A versatile programming language created by Guido van Rossum, first released in 1991.

# Hello World Program
print("Hello, World!")

# Checking Python Installation and Version
# Command-line:
# python --version

# Running Python in Command Line
# Command-line:
# python
# exit()

# Creating a Python File
# Python code typically resides in files with a .py extension.
# Example: Create a file named sample.py and add Python code to it.

# Variables in Python
# Variables store data. Unlike some languages, Python doesn't require declaring the data type explicitly.

x = 'Hello World'  # Example: Assigning a string to a variable named x

# Comments in Python
# Use # for single-line comments and ''' ''' for multi-line comments.

# Data Types
# Python supports various data types:
# - Integers: Whole numbers.
# - Floats: Numbers with decimal points.
# - Strings: Text, enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.
# - Booleans: True or False values, used for logical operations.

# Examples of Data Types:

age = 30  # Integer
height = 5.3  # Float
name = "Ana"  # String
is_python_fun = True  # Boolean

# Printing Variables
# Use print() to display the value of variables.

print(x)  # Output: Hello World
print(age)  # Output: 30
print(height)  # Output: 5.3
print(name)  # Output: Ana
print(is_python_fun)  # Output: True
